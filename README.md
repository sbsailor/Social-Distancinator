# Social-Distancinator
A social distancing hat that triggers an audio and visual alarm when it detects a person within 6 feet. Utilises LiDar, ultrasonic sensors, a 3 axis accelerometer, and an Arduino to identify people via a simple velocity classification algorithm. 
This repository contains the Arduino Code for the final product, as well as a demo for each subsytem sensor.
